# CIS11 Test Score Calculator Program 
### Create an LC-3 program that displays the minimum, maximum and average grade of 5 test scores and display the letter grade  associated with the test scores. 
```
Input: User is prompt to input the test scores.
Output: Display maximum, minimum, average score and letter grade equivalence 
        (0 – 50 = F, 60 – 69 = D, 70 – 79 = C, 80 – 89 = B, 90 – 100 = A) on the console.
```
### The program must fulfill the following criteria:
1.	Contain appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output. (20 points)
2.	Display min/max/avg values in console. (20 points)
3.	Use appropriate labels and comments. (20 points)
4.	Contain appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations. (40 points)
5.	Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls. (20 points)
6.	Use branching for control: conditional and iterative. (30 points)
7.	Manage overflow and storage allocation. (20 points)
8.	Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack. (20 points)
9.	Include save-restore operations. (30 points)
10.	Include pointer (20 points)
11.	Implement ASCII conversion operations (30 points)
12.	Use appropriate system call directives. (10 point)
13.	Testing (20 points): Test the program using the below values

### Allocated Tasks for each member:
1.       Multi-character input - Sam
2.       Create stack for test scores ability to push/pop test scores - Jason
3.   	Analytical functions
        a.   	Minimum function - Jason
        b.   	Maximum function  - Randy
        c.   	Average function - Sam
4.       Convert data to readable text - Randy
5.       Output to console

### Projected Task Completion Timeline:
5/21: Get started on documentation as well as the min, max, avg functions

5/23: Documentation completed, continue working on min, max, avg functions

5/28: Work on ASCII to decimal value conversion and multi character input

5/30: Continue work on multi character input and get started on output

6/03: Finish output, test program, fix any problems that arise
